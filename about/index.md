Hi. I'm Matt Swanson.

I'm a software engineer who values lightweight agile processes, TDD, and good design. But above all: shipping.

I enjoy building simple apps that people love using.

I live and [work](http://www.sep.com/) in Indianapolis, IN. I went to school at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) ([ECE &rsquo;10](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE)). I do a little bit of everything, but I'm happiest working with Ruby or Android.

I'm always learning and trying to improve my craft; I consider writing software to be one of my most enjoyable hobbies and usually have some kind of side-project I'm hacking on. I come at problems with an Engineer's Mindset and am always striving to write clean, readable code.

I run a monthly newsletter for Indiana developers ([Indy Hackers](http://indyhackers.org/)) and organize a weekly "get stuff done" group ([Indy Startup Lab](http://indystartuplab.org)). I'm a regular speaker at the local Ruby meetup ([IndyRB](http://indyrb.org)). I also help run an infrequent table tennis league for tech companies in the Indianapolis area ([ITTTL](http://itttl.org)). I spearheaded an [internal "Startup Weekend" event](http://www.sep.com/labs/startupweekend/) at SEP that has been going on for four years now.

I watch way too much TV.
